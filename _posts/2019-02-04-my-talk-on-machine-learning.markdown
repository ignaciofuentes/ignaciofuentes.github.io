Back in October of last year I gave a talk at [jsmobileconf](https://jsmobileconf.com/) in Boston.

It was a very nice event hosted by Progress (my employer). I had the chance to meet a lot of people in the exciting NativeScript community.
I hope I get to go this year as well as I'm sure this event will only get bigger!!

This was my first time giving this talk so some things could be polished even further.
Kudos to the Microsoft Cognitive Services and Azure ML Studio teams for making their tools so easy to get started with.
